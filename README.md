# Modulation-Format-Classification

This project is the final project of communication principles course.

## Requirements

The requirement is to achieve the **digital modulation format classification under addictive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel**

+ plot the **block diagram**
+ **MATLAB code**
+ run the simulation at least 100 times and calculate the **accuracy** and **signal noise ratio (SNR)**

## Developing Environment

MATLAB R2019a (recommended)

*NOT* earlier than MATLAB R2016a

## Notice

+ All variables and functions should have **specific** and **clear** names.
+ Adding proper comments to improve the readability is recommended.
+ Using **camel case** to name variables is recommended. *(e.g. myVariableName)*
+ Using **underline case** to name functions is recommended. *(e.g. my_function_name)*
