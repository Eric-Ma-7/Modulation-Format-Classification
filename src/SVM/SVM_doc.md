# SVM

The codes in this folder use high order cumulants to identify different modulation format using SVM partly.

## Modulation supported 

| modulation | bit per symbol | class |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 2PSK       | 1              | PSK   |
| 8PSK       | 3              | PSK   |
| QPSK       | 2              | QAM   |
| 8QAM       | 3              | QAM   |
| 16QAM      | 4              | QAM   |
| 32QAM      | 5              | QAM   |

Signals in all modulation formats can be generated by `dataset_generate.m`, which can be specified by parameter.

## Higher-order cumulants

Higher-order cumulants are defined as

M is the mixing moment:

The use of higher-order cumulants can significantly suppress Gaussian white noise. And different format of modulation often show different statistics. We use three statistics below to identify different formats of signals:

16QAM, QPSK and 8PSK signals will be classified directly.

## SVM Training

For 2PSK, 8QAM, and 32QAM, we can use SVM to train three models. Generate signals randomly and select these signaled marked '2PSK' , '32QAM' or '8QAM', then training three models targeted. 

For example, when training a model for '2PSK', all the rest signals will be set as 'others'. Calculate the higher-order cumulants and then use `fitcsvm()` function to train.

All the models will be saved to the current directory.

##  Validation

` validation.m` use 100 sets of signals with random format and random snr rate to calculate the correct rate.
